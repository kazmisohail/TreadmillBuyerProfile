# Treadmill Buyer Profile
It is my EDA portfolio project as a part of AI bootcamp by atomcamp and NUST.

## Project Details:
The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target
audience for each type of treadmill oƯered by the company, to provide a better
recommendation of the treadmills to new customers. The team decides to investigate
whether there are diƯerences across the product with respect to customer
characteristics.
