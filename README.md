# TreadmillBuyerProfile
It is my EDA portfolio project as a part of AI bootcamp by atomcamp and NUST.

## Project Details:
The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target
audience for each type of treadmill oƯered by the company, to provide a better
recommendation of the treadmills to new customers. The team decides to investigate
whether there are diƯerences across the product with respect to customer
characteristics.

## Practicalities:
Analyse the provided data and provide insights to the best of your abilities. Include the
relevant tables/graphs/visualization to explain what you have learned about the data.
You may structure your EDA/Business Analysis according to these steps:
1. Data Exploration and Processing:

* Importing data
* Reading dataframe
* Check the shape of the dataframe
* Datatype of each column
* Missing value detection
* Checking duplicate values in the dataset

2. Statistical Summary:
 Provide an analysis of the statistical summary in few lines for both categorical and
numerical features.

3. Non-Graphical Analysis:
 Value Counts for all categorical features
 Unique Attributes for all categorical features

4. Graphical Analysis:
 Univariate Analysis - Numerical features:
o Distribution Plot
o Count Plot
o Box Plot
 Univariate Analysis - Categorical features:
o Count Plot
 Bivariate Analysis:
o Check features eƯect on the product purchased e.g.
 Product vs Gender
 Product vs MaritalStatus
 Product vs Age
 Multivariate Analysis:
o Create pairplots to show relationship of features

5. Correlation Analysis:
 Show the correlation matrix on heatmap and write your observation of findings in
few lines.

6. Outlier Detection:
 Check for the outliers by using the IQR method.

7. Conditional Probabilities:
 What percent of customers have purchased KP281, KP481, or KP781?
 Create frequency tables and calculate the percentage as follows
o Product – Gender
 Percentage of a Male customer purchasing a treadmill
 # Percentage of a Female customer purchasing KP781 treadmill
 Probability of a customer being a Female given that Product is
KP281
o Product – Age
 Percentage of customers with Age between 20s and 30s among all
customers
o Product – Income
 Percentage of a low-income customer purchasing a treadmill
 Percentage of a high-income customer purchasing KP781
treadmill
 Percentage of customer with high-income salary buying treadmill
given that Product is KP781

o Product – Fitness
 Percentage of customers that have fitness level 5
 Percentage of a customer with Fitness Level 5 purchasing KP781
treadmill
 Percentage of customer with fitness level 5 buying KP781
treadmill
o Product - Marital Status
 Percentage of a customers who are partnered using treadmills

8. Actionable Insights & Recommendations:
Provide detailed report on the actionable insights and recommendations according
to your observations.
